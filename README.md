## Installation

To run the Cell Image Analyzer locally, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, you can install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies, including Streamlit, OpenCV, and scikit-image.

## Usage
To start the app, simply run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser. You can then upload an image of cells to analyze and adjust the various settings to customize the analysis. Once you are satisfied with the results, you can export the measurements to a CSV file for further analysis.
